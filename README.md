This lightbox displays images using an AngularUI Bootstrap Modal.

When the lightbox is opened, navigating to the previous/next image can be
achieved by clicking buttons above the image, clicking the left/right arrow
keys. The escape key for closing the lightbox modal is automatically binded by
AngularUI Bootstrap.

Each image is scaled to fit inside the window. An optional image caption
overlays the top left corner of the image.
